A collection of solutions to challenges on pythonchallenge.com

Unfortunately it is very disorganized, at the time I was just concerned with solving the problems so I could move onto the next. It's also made slightly worse because I used command line arguments to input anything so it's also difficult to tell what each program is suppose to work on what input. I'm including all the files from my pythonchallenge folder to be sure that everything is included, I may clean it up later.

There are 15 .py files so it seems I did 15 challenges but I may have modified some to complete later similar challenges and not kept the original.
